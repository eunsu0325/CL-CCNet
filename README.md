# 🥥 CoCoNut: Continual & Competition Network with Updatable Templates

> **Where Competition meets Continual Learning for Intelligent Adaptation**

## 🎯 Project Overview

CoCoNut is an advanced **continual learning system** for touchless palmprint recognition, implementing a novel **2-stage learning strategy** that combines robust pre-training with intelligent online adaptation.

### 🔥 Key Innovation: W2ML-Enhanced Learning

| Stage | Method | Goal |
|-------|--------|------|
| **Stage 1 (Pretrain)** | Hybrid Loss (ArcFace + SupCon) | Build robust feature space |
| **Stage 2 (Adapt)** | W2ML-based difficulty-aware learning | Smart adaptation to new data |

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
CoCoNut = CCNet + W2ML + Intelligent Replay Buffer
```

### Core Components

- **🧠 CCNet**: Gabor-based competition network for palmprint feature extraction
- **⚖️ W2ML Integration**: Hard sample mining with difficulty-weighted learning  
- **🔄 Intelligent Replay**: Diversity-based experience replay with Faiss indexing

---

## 📊 Mathematical Foundation

### Stage 1 - Hybrid Loss
```
L_pretrain = α × L_ArcFace + β × L_SupCon
where α = 0.8, β = 0.2 (empirically validated)
```

### Stage 2 - W2ML Loss
```
L_adapt = -Σ w_i × log(p_i)
where w_i computed via W2ML Equations (6) & (7)
```

**W2ML Parameters** (from Pattern Recognition 2022):
- `α = 2.0`, `β = 40.0`, `γ = 0.5`
- Hard Positive threshold = `0.5`
- Hard Negative threshold = `0.7`

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1️⃣ Installation

```bash
# GPU environment (recommended)
pip install torch torchvision faiss-gpu
pip install -r requirements.txt

# CPU environment  
pip install torch torchvision faiss-cpu
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2️⃣ Data Preparation

```bash
./data/train_tongji.txt     # Pre-training data
./data/test_tongji.txt      # Validation data  
/path/to/live/palm_data     # Online adaptation data
```

### 3️⃣ Execution

#### Stage 1: Pre-training
```bash
python pretrain.py
```
- Uses `config/pretrain_config.yaml`
- Applies hybrid loss (ArcFace + SupCon)
- Builds robust feature space foundation

#### Stage 2: Online Adaptation
```bash
python run_coconut.py
```
- Uses `config/adapt_config.yaml`
- Applies W2ML difficulty-aware learning
- Performs continual adaptation
